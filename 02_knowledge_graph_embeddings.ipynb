    "One thing to notice here is that all of the top 10 closely related entities for `california.n.01` are also synsets. Similarly for lemma `california`, the most closely related entities are also lemmas, although some synsets also made it into the top 10 neighbours. This may indicate a tendency of `HolE` to keep lemmas close to other lemmas and synsets close to other synsets. In general, choices about how nodes in the KG are related will affect how their embeddings are interrelated."

    "We have used code similar to the one shown above to train embeddings for 500 epochs using HolE. You can execute the following cells to download and explore these embeddings. The embeddings are about 142MB, so dowloading them may take a few minutes."
